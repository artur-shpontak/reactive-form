# ReactiveForm

To see preview: [DEMO LINK](https://artur-shpontak.github.io/reactive-form/)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.10.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### `npm run deploy`

Create a temporary clone of the current repository, create a `gh-pages` branch if one doesn't already exist, copy over all files from the `dist` folder, or only those that match patterns from the optional src configuration, commit all changes, and push to the origin remote.

If a `gh-pages` branch already exists, it will be updated with all commits from the remote before adding any commits from the provided src files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
